<h1>I'm Ethan, a Full-Stack Web Developer 👋 </h1>

<a href="">Full Resume</a>

<h2>About Me ☕</h2> <br>
I'm a 20-year-old Full Stack Web Developer based in the vibrant city of Berkeley, California. You can find me at my desk: my playground where I constantly code, build, and experiment. Otherwise, I am likely playing chess, exercising outdoors, or enjoying my roast at a cafe with friends!

<br>

<h2>Tech Background  🛠️</h2> <br>
Since high school, I have deeply invested myself in the world of programming. It started off with a passion for solving problems using the magic of programming and slowly grew into a (healthy, I think) obsession of building websites. Now, I find myself programming everyday on full-stack web applications. 🛠️

<br>
<br>

<h2>Skillset  💻</h2> <br>
I specialize in <strong>React</strong> for front-end development, and <strong>Spring Boot/Express</strong> for backend development. Additionally, I'm proficient in many other tools like Redux, TypeScript, AWS, and Docker. My expertise lies in crafting scalable and efficient APIs, backed by over 2 years of experience in this niche. 💻
