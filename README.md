<h2>About Me â˜•</h2> <br>
Hi! I'm Ethan, a 20-year-old Full Stack Web Developer based in the vibrant city of Berkeley, California. You can find me at my desk: my playground where I constantly code, build, and experiment. Otherwise, I am likely playing chess, exercising outdoors, or enjoying my roast at a cafe with friends!

<br>
<br>

<h2>Skillset  ðŸ’»</h2> <br>
I specialize in <strong>React</strong> for front-end development, and <strong>Spring Boot/Express</strong> for backend development. Additionally, I'm proficient in many other tools like Redux, TypeScript, AWS, and Docker. My expertise lies in crafting scalable and efficient APIs, backed by over 2 years of experience in this niche. ðŸ’»
